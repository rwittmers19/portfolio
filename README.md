# Personal Portfolio [![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/22af907f-f2c0-42bf-af2c-ee7a7b0af74e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/ryanwittmers/deploys)

This repository maintains all content for my personal website. The site is then built, run, and deployed by
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

This site draws heavy inspiration from [Jacobo Martinez](https://github.com/cobiwave/simplefolio)'s simplefolio.
